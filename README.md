# OpenBLEButton

The idea behind this project is to develop a generic BLE interface, a BLE WiFi gateway and a cloud service.

It should ideally contain schematics for two devices minimum and firmware for them.

Platforms under investigation are: Nordic NRF51 for the button and ESP32 for the gateway.

Open to contributions!
